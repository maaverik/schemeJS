# schemeJS
A rudimentary scheme interpreter written in Javascript

Most of the scheme commands work just like they do in the standard scheme interpreter.

I referred this link to make it: http://norvig.com/lispy.html

The terminal lookalike was made using Jquery terminal plugin. Refer this: http://terminal.jcubic.pl/
